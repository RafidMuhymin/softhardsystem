A niche is crucial and also highly beneficial to start any online presence. It also applies to a podcast, as it applies to a blog and YouTube channel. Another important thing is creating the best content. It’ll make you stand out from the crowd and increase your followers.

You have to submit your episodes to the right channels to get enough podcast downloads. You should at least list your podcasts in iTunes, Stitcher, Spotify, and Google Podcasts. There are also many other directories to upload your podcast.

### 4\. Launch a Startup Business

![](./images/image-34-1024x682.jpeg)

Do you’ve got a great business idea in your mind? Do you want to launch a startup of your own? Everyone has a dream like this. But only some people can do it. Launching a startup business is a whole different thing than having an idea. It’s an intimidating task. But once you’ve successfully done it, you can earn millions of dollars.

You need to have a well-prepared business plan first. You need everything strategized to launch and successfully run a business.

You need to have adequate capital prior to starting a business. You can’t just have a good idea without enough money. Running a business requires some employees, an office, and of course, a website is a must. You can’t make money online without having a website. And all these cost money.

You need to collect enough money before launching a business. But a bank may not want to give a loan to a small business that has just started its journey. Your family and friends can help you in this case.

Moreover, if you have an excellent idea, then you can pitch it to an investor. Venture Capitalists alone invested 61 billion in small businesses in 2019! But the problem is, they don’t invest in every sector. 50% of their investments were in the Software & Technology sector.

When you’ve launched the startup, you need to do effective marketing to attract customers. Content Marketing is the best way to promote your products. Social Media and Search Engine Marketing come after this. And there is nothing better than starting a blog for doing these.

You can also go for traditional advertisement models like PPC, or TV and Radio channel ads. If you’re unsure about what to do, you should better hire a marketer who is an expert on these.

To grow your startup into a successful business, you need to do nothing else but keep repeating the process. You need to tackle the roadblocks that come in your way. Mistake and loss can happen, but it doesn’t mean you’ve failed. Just learn from the past and keep your business growing. Nothing can stop you from achieving success.

Perhaps a few bucks, or a few thousand, or even a few millions! Or a tremendous $193 billion of dollars!!!!! It’s the total worth of Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, and the world’s richest man! He is worth even more than the video-sharing platform YouTube!

#### Essential Websites & Apps: Shopify

### 5\. Start an Electronic Store

![](./images/image-4-1024x1024.png)

E-commerce is getting increasingly popular. As everyone now wants to work from home. And starting an online store is a convenient way to do that.

If you want to start an electronic store, first, you’ve to figure out what type of products you’ll sell. If you want to sell electronic products, you’ll don’t need to invest a large amount of money. Perhaps, you’ll not need capital at all.

But if you sell physical products, you need to have adequate capital first. Otherwise, you may end up closing your business eventually.

If you have the required money, go, and create a website first. And create an account on Amazon and eBay. Don’t leave these great opportunities!

Shopify has a full-suite for starting an E-commerce website. From hosting to selling products and building a customer base. It has excellent tools and features that will help you to run an e-store successfully. Click here to get a 14-day free Shopify trial.

If you want a free alternative, then you can use the free WooCommerce plugin. Once you’ve made some money, you can upgrade to Shopify or WooCommerce premium.

Just starting a website won’t help you to sell your products. You’ve to promote your products effectively. And again, blogging is the best choice. Use Content Marketing, Search Engine, Social Media, and other marketing tactics to drive traffic to your business blog. You should also build an email list and send updates and promotional deals to your existing customers.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online from an E-Store

There is no exact figure of how much money you’ll earn from an e-commerce store. On average, an e-commerce website generates around $1 million monthly revenue after three years! It's a high enough number to satisfy most people.

#### Essential Websites & Apps: Shopify, WooCommerce

### 6\. Build and Sell an Application Software

![](./images/image-49-1024x878.jpeg)

Software packages probably are the best product in the online market. We are always in need of useful apps. And people don’t hesitate to pay for a nifty tool.

And many people even earn 7-figure income for this helping. If you can build an excellent app and execute your plan correctly, perhaps you’re going to be a millionaire very soon!

To build a useful app, you need a great idea first. You’ve to find a problem or many problems that your software can solve or prevent from occurring.

After you’ve got an idea, you need to convert that idea into an app. Either hire a group of developers or build it yourself.

The second way may be cheap, but it’ll take years to build a single app. But, if you succeed, the full profit is yours. Again, if it fails, there is no risk. As you didn’t spend much.

But definitely, it’s better to hire a team of developers. Though it can cost you thousands of dollars, it doesn’t matter. Because the profits can go over millions of dollars! And the other developers will help you to achieve it.

You mustn’t hire cheap developers. Quality is much more important than money. You can easily list your job in the freelancing sites like Freelancer.com, Upwork, etc. Or, you can search for a skilled developer in platforms like Gun.io, TopTal, Hired, GitHub Jobs, etc. Coding forums are also great for finding a developer.

After you’ve hired a developer or a team, you need to discuss with them actively. You need to let them know what you want. You can’t stay silent. And keep patience. It takes a lot of time to build an app.

At last, when the application has been created, you need a place to sell your software. You’ll need a dedicated website or at least a landing page. Then you have to set up the payment systems.

You must create some how-to videos and written tutorials on how to use the app. It’ll not be easy for everyone to understand the interface of a new tool. You can use YouTube and your website to publish the guides.

You should also set up some coupons and offers for sales and discounts. And you must have an option for affiliates because they are the prime boosters.

Now is the time for promoting. The best choice is starting a blog. It’ll also help you to get some pre-orders. You can email your newsletter subscribers about the application. You should also email to famous online entrepreneurs, who can be your potential customer.

If you’ve created the best app possible, and have done marketing effectively, then probably it has started generating money. And buyers are also sending emails asking for support. And you must respond to them and solve their problems.

Customer Service and Ongoing Maintenance are as important as building an application. These are a must to generate steady revenue. But replying to thousands of emails isn’t easy for one person. You should better hire some support staff to do this.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online Selling an App

Many people have gone zero to a millionaire in a month, just building an app. How much money you’ll earn depends on various factors. Such as how much you’ll sell your software for, its usefulness, the marketing methods, etc.

If you’re making $20 per sale and selling only 100 copies every month, you’ll still earn $2,000/mo. And what if your software goes viral? And 100,000 copies get sold? You’ll make $2 million in just a month!

You’ve to price your software correctly to make a decent amount of money. You’ve to charge a price which is both profitable to you and reasonable to your customers.

### 7\. Build and Sell a Course

![](./images/image-8-1024x768.png)

Courses are getting increasingly popular. But why? Because educational fees are exploding every year. And there are no signs of stopping. Students can't afford it. And as a result, student loan debt is also rising every year.

At the same time, the e-Learning market is booming. Because it is flexible, anyone can learn anytime, from anywhere. E-learning has covered almost every topic possible. It is expected to grow past $241 billion by 2022.

And it’s a lot cheaper also. Technologies also have advanced a lot. Now tutors can discuss complex theories and provide sophisticated and interactive instructions on a video. So, the best courses from the experts are now being created.

Many people are earning millions of dollars selling their course programs. You can also make a lot of money from a successful online course in a short period.

But there are thousands of experts to compete with you. So, to stand out from the crowd, you’ve to produce the best course possible. If you’ve got an excellent idea in your head, then the next step is creating it.

#### How to Create and Sell A Course

You should choose an online course creation tool instead of WordPress or WooCommerce to create a course. The two best tools among them are Kajabi and Udemy. Udemy is the most popular course-building tool. But, Kajabi also has all the features one needs, has beautiful designs, and is more user-friendly.

To create a course, first, add a landing page and some content pages. You should assume each content page as a lesson and group them into modules.

After the course has been created, you have to get it to as many people as possible. Kajabi has a unique _Pipelines_ feature for this to automate all the processes of marketing.

After you’ve done marketing, you should add coupons and offers to increase sales. You must invite and manage affiliates to promote your course. You should also automate the whole process of sharing revenue with them. Kajabi has built-in features for managing all of these.

_Effective marketing_ is a must to get enough sales for anything. You must email your subscribers and your potential customers. You can also start a blog series before publishing your course.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online Selling Courses

Many tutors are already earning hundreds of thousands of dollars online. You can make that also if you can come up with a comprehensive course and market it effectively.

Like software, you’ll have to set a high-enough price for your course that is both reasonable to you and your customers. For example, you should charge around $100 for a medium-size course program.

But you can clearly charge $300-$500 or even more for a comprehensive course that explains everything in-depth.

If you are charging $200 for your course, you can easily earn $20,000 a month!! And you need only 100 sales a month for this!

### 8\. Start Freelancing

![](./images/image-31-1024x680.jpeg)

Freelancing means working freely with many companies at the same time. You aren’t limited to just a single organization. Freelance projects aren’t long-term like your day job. Most of them are short-term. And you can work on different projects at the same time. This makes freelancing a great way to earn money online.

To become a successful freelancer, you should do some basic things first. You should build a portfolio website to highlight your works. And try to be a specialist in a particular niche, not a generalist. It’ll help you to be an expert in your working sector and let you charge premium rates for your works.

If you’re just starting as a freelancer, you’ll face many difficulties. At first, perhaps you can’t charge a decent rate for your work. Because everyone wants to hire an expert and not an inexperienced beginner.

To gain some experience and knowledge first, you can start blogging. You’ll be able to represent your content before your clients. It can help you greatly to collect potential clients.

You should create accounts on as many freelancing websites as possible. Doing this will increase your chances of getting work. Some popular freelancing sites are Upwork, Freelancer.com, Fiverr, PeoplePerHour, Guru, etc.

SolidGigs and FlexJobs are also two great curated-job platforms to get freelancing jobs. There are also particular freelancing platforms for each category. Such as Contena for writers, Gun.io for developers, 99designs for designers, etc.

Most of the freelancing websites will cut a percentage of your earnings as a fee. So, you’ll not be able to get the full amount to keep. And also, you might not get paid well because you’ll have to bid to win a job. And many times, the lowest bidder wins the job.

And even if a freelancing platform doesn’t have fees for a freelancer, it’ll charge a fee to the employer. If he doesn’t want to spend extra, he can end up paying you less.

So, once you’ve gained some experience, you should start receiving clients directly through your blog or cold-emailing. Or, you should focus on the category-based platforms. Social Media is also a great place to collect potential clients.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online Freelancing

You’ll not earn much as a new freelancer. Perhaps, you’ll get paid only $10 an hour. But you’ll become skilled and gain a reputation progressively. Then you can certainly charge much more than $10.

Some successful freelancers charge up to $250/hr or even more. It translates into an annual salary of whopping $500,000!!! And you’ll earn much more than that if you work more than 8 hours a day!

Writing and publishing an ebook has become easier than ever before. Because of the self-publishing platforms, anyone can now self-publish their own books online. So, the royalties are much higher than paperbacks.

If you want to write an ebook, a niche is crucial. Because if you’re writing your first ebook, perhaps no one will buy it. As there are books from many established writers.

After you’ve selected a niche, write the ebook. If you have a blog, then creating an ebook might be easier for you. As you may already have content for your ebook in your blog. You just have to repackage those.

After you’ve written an ebook, get it proofread by an expert. And you need to design a great cover also. You should hire someone to do this for you because you might not be good at this. And the first impression is the last impression!

If you’re done with designing a great ebook cover, quickly publish it. Amazon Kindle, Nook, Apple Books, Kobo, etc. are some great places for publishing your ebook.

But you should try to make as many sales as possible on your own. Because you can keep all the profits of the sales.

You should spend enough time marketing your ebook. You can use your blog, social media followers, and contact famous authors, your friends, and your family.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online Selling Ebooks

The importance of online presence is now more than ever before. As a result, the number of websites is increasing rapidly. And to help the webmasters, website building tools have been emerged to make their work easy.

But still, it isn’t so easy to build a great website without knowing codes. And doing technical things and customization can be confusing for many people also. And concentrating on learning codes rather than the business might not be the best choice.

So, web developers are still hired and paid generously. If you know HTML, CSS, and some basics of JavaScript, you can start your career or a side-hustle as a web developer. You can also extend your knowledge by learning PHP, Ruby on Rails, and some other languages. These will help you to land higher-paying jobs.

If you have the necessary knowledge, then the next step is getting clients. The market is full of developers. So, you’ve to work hard to stand out.

First, make sure what services you can offer. If you can only build websites, then don’t try to develop web apps. Work in a specific niche. A niche is vital for every sector. Because it helps to gain expertise quicker and find potential clients.

At first, no one might want to hire you. So, try to get your first client from your friends and family to build some portfolio first. Also, join freelancing platforms such as Freelancer.com, Upwork, Fiverr. There are also specialized platforms for skilled developers, such as Gun.io, TopTal, Lemon.io, etc.

Local businesses need their own websites also. Email them offering to build their websites. LinkedIn and FlexJobs are also two great places to find potential clients.

### 12\. Sell Websites

![](./images/halacious-tZc3vjPCk-Q-unsplash-1024x683.jpg)

Like building websites, selling websites is also an excellent way to earn money online. Thanks to the developers, building a website has become easier than ever. Anyone can create a website and launch it in just a few hours. It just needs buying a domain name and web hosting. And then installing WordPress to create a website easily.

To create a website for selling, you must build a niche-site. Because only niche-sites are perfect for sale. You must buy a great domain name also, which represents the niche. Then just set up web hosting and install WordPress to build the websites.

Two types of websites are sold. The first one is a starter website. A starter website won’t make you rich. But a site that took you just a few hours to build can be sold at $1000 or even more.

Or, you can post some content on your site. Do proper keyword research and build links. Once it starts making some money, you list it for sale. You can ask 15X-36X money than the monthly revenue!!!

There are many websites where you can list your website for sale. Flippa and EmpireFlippers are the two most popular sites among them.

You may have to hire a broker to sell a website. He may take around 20% of the sold price as his fee.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online Selling Websites

Starter websites are great for making some quick money. It just takes a few hours to build a good-looking website. Probably, you can create 30, 50, or more sites in a month. And, if you can sell only 5 websites a month, you’ll still earn $5,000!!

But established sites are much more profitable if you can work hard. If a website Is making $3,000/mo, then you can get anywhere between $45K-$108K selling the website!!! That’s still a hefty $30K-$80K after all the expenses!!!

### 13\. Proofread Documents

![](./images/image-4-1024x682.jpeg)

Are you an expert at finding typographical errors? Do you have a great sense of grammar and have a vast vocabulary? Put those skills into work. You can earn good money by proofreading documents.

Proofreading is necessary for every kind of writing. Everyone from bloggers to large brands needs to proofread their content. Many people proofread their documents on their own. But many people will bring in help to take out all the mistakes.

Copyediting is the next level of proofreading. You’ll earn more if you can provide copyediting in addition to basic proofreading. Copyeditors suggest considerable changes to a document. Those changes are far above common grammatical errors and can improve a document’s clarity, conciseness, and consistency.

Many organizations hire experienced and expert proofreaders. But most of them at least require a degree to prove expertise. Some even require a Ph.D. in English.

But these degrees aren't a must as you can freelance your clients. You just need to have proofreading (and copy-editing) skills. You can list your service in freelancing sites or directly email clients with some samples of your work.

You’ll have to practice and practice be a skilled proofreader. You’ll also have to be very fast at proofreading, like 40 pages an hour. And you should add copy-editing to your skill. A copy-editor earns much more than a proofreader.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online Proofreading

You may earn a lot less in the beginning. But as you make progress, you’ll be able to charge higher rates such as $30/hr or more, as for most projects, you’ll get paid at a flat rate, try to work quickly. If you can proofread 2X fast, you’ll make 2X money!!

A copy-editor earns much more than a proofreader. Even an amateur copy-editor can charge up to $25/hr. While an experienced one can charge up to $100/hr. Generally, a copy-editor edits 2-5 pages an hour. So they earn over $500 to up to $5,000 just from a 100-page book!

But to make money online from teaching, you need to be an expert in a subject. You can’t start teaching people knowing very little.

If you have a blog and have built a course, you'll earn passive income also. So, let’s do some simple math to calculate how much money you can make.

I’ve told you that a successful blog can make you $5K-$6K per month, and a comprehensive course can make $20K per month easily. Though those can take months or years to build, you’ll earn a steady passive income every month.

So, after adding all the amounts, a successful online teacher can earn a decent $30K or even more every month!!! So, if you’re only 20% successful, that’s still a cool $72K per year!

Writing is an excellent way to earn money online. Many writers are earning millions of dollars online. And if you’re a great writer, you’ll be able to make a decent amount of money writing online.

But you need to keep in mind that you can’t be rich just writing anywhere. But it is very possible to meet your need. You can offer different types of writings, such as technical writing, copywriting, or creative writing.

If you want to offer writing services to clients, then you mightn’t get the best value for your work. Because a writer is generally poorly-paid. You’ll earn as high as $50 per 1000 words, while the median is around just $10-$20. And you’ll also have to do research before writing. So, it’s not a great way to earn money writing online.

### 18\. Earn Money Online as A Programmer

![](./images/image-33-1024x574.jpeg)

The days are gone when knowing how to code was a must to use a computer. Today we don't need to write a single line of codes to do anything, not even to build a website. It's called the no-code revolution.

But don't think that programmers have gone useless. They’re the men who made using the internet and computer so easy for us. They’re the people who have started the no-code revolution, not us.

There are numerous programming languages, and the number is still growing. Of these, the fundamentals are C, C++, Objective-C, Swift, Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, etc.

A programmer has to know multiple programming languages. But don't think that you need to learn all the languages to start making money.

You just need to learn the essential languages. For example, to develop an iOS app, you must learn Swift and Objective-C. If you want to build websites, then you’ve to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

If you know how to program, then probably you'll want to apply for a Software Engineer's position. A software engineer is paid generously. But it's not the single way to utilize your knowledge.

I’ve already talked about how to earn money online by building and selling software. You can also go ahead and develop your own app. It can be a great source of income if you can come up with a useful tool.

Game-building is also as good as building software. You can make a lot of quick money if you can create an exciting game. But keep in mind that, though game-building may be more profitable and lucrative, it takes much more time and money than developing software.

Python is a highly valuable programming language. But it's not so hard to learn. It is used for data analytics, data protection, machine learning, to optimize data algorithm, build websites, and for many other purposes. Many companies hire Python developers. And they’re willing to pay you over $100K a year if you’re an expert in Python.

Not just Python, you can get hired if you know any programming language. Many entrepreneurs want to build their own software. But they don’t know to program, or it isn’t possible to finish the work for one person. You’ll find such jobs in the freelancing marketplaces. Or, you can directly approach a client with your own idea, if you think they are interested.

Again, you can make money by offering your programming services. You can use the freelancing sites, social media, your website, cold emailing to get clients.

Teaching is also a great way to earn side income as a programmer. You can start a blog or a YouTube channel and produce helpful content, build and sell courses, write an ebook, etc. Many people are interested to learn different programming languages. So, it’ll not be hard to get students.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online as a Programmer

A software engineer is paid generously. And using the other online methods like blogging, courses, YouTube channel, you can boost your earnings. Some programmers like _Sergey Aleynikov_ make more than a million per year!

### 19\. Become a Graphic Designer

![](./images/image-40-1024x682.jpeg)

Graphic-designing is a highly sought-after skill. Because everyone wants eye-catching graphics wherever they are present on the internet. On our website, social media posts, company logo, etc. And if you have the necessary skills, then you can make good money online from it.

As a Graphic Designer, you’ve so many opportunities to earn online. There's no shortage of how many things you can do. You can design logos, custom fonts, Pinterest pins, advertisements, ebook covers, textures, t-shirts, and many other graphics.

Now, it comes to getting clients. I’ve already talked about it a lot of times. Use social media, freelancing sites, and cold email potential clients. And be selective about taking works. Only work on the projects you know you are capable of completing.

You should also create and sell digital files in online marketplaces. You can create reusable templates, fonts, images, textures, and list those for sale. You can sell those individually or as a media kit. You can definitely get $5 for a single graphic, and $500 for a media kit that has 100 graphics. This makes it a great source of passive income.

Building and selling WordPress Themes is also an excellent idea. It is a highly profitable business model. Many theme companies have been evolved just for building WP Themes. And they are making millions of millions of dollars. So, it can be a great source of income if you can come up with one or multiple awesome themes.

Many people are interested to learn Graphic Designing. And you can make money by sharing your knowledge with them. And the best way to do this is to start a blog and teach people how to become a graphic designer. You can also create a YouTube channel, build and sell courses, host workshops, write an ebook, etc.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online as A Graphic Designer

The median salary of a graphic designer in the US is just over $40,000. But with so many options available online for graphic designers, such as selling designs, courses, WP themes, starting a blog, YouTube channel, a graphic designer can definitely bring in another cool $5K-$6K per month.

Freelance graphic designers can earn even more. Even an inexperienced designer can get around $25/hr, and some experienced designers charge up to $200, $300, or even more per hour!!!

Everyone loves delicious foods. Because people don’t eat to live, they live to eat! And if you cook well, you can make good money online from your cooking skill.

If you’re thinking about earning money cooking, then probably you’ll want to go for traditional ways like starting a restaurant or being a chef.

There isn’t any delicious ingredient online to cook foods. But there are many helpful websites and programs to make money. And cooking is also not excluded.

The best way to earn money online by cooking is starting a YouTube channel. Nowadays, people are searching for video tutorials for every type of recipe. They are trying new things and improving their cooking skills.

You aren’t limited to just a YouTube cooking channel. You can start a food blog, build and sell courses, etc.

You can also build and sell a cooking course. And I think it'll not be hard for you. Because you may already have a lot of YT videos and blog posts.

### 21\. Become A Data Analyst

![](./images/image-7-1024x576.jpeg)

Data is the most valuable property in this global village. From small to large, most businesses are collecting data from their customers. And, they’re using the data insights to improve their strategy and grow their business.

But not everyone knows how to play with numbers. So, businesses hire a player who can play with numbers. Those players are called data analyst. If you’re a numbers man, then you can use your skill to make money online.

Though you may not need a background in data analysis, you’ll need various skills to be a data analyst. Just having an analytical mindset won't work. You need to-

Another great way to earn money online as a data analyst is by teaching people how to analyze data. And the best way to do this is by starting a blog on data science. Building online courses on data analysis is also a profitable teaching idea.

![](./images/image-68-1024x840.jpeg)

We need English in our everyday life even if we aren't native. But probably you’re a native English speaker. And many people are willing to pay you a decent amount of money to learn English.

When you’re thinking of making money online by teaching people English, a TEFL course will help you a lot. Because many websites have some requirements, and most of them require a TEFL. Some even require a degree. But don’t worry if you’ve neither. You can still earn good money teaching English online.

There are many websites to teach English online. Some are exclusive to English, while most of them allow teaching other languages. Among them, the bests are VIPKid, English First, Italki, Verbling, PalFish, Tandem.

### 23\. Teach People Languages Online

![](./images/image-3-1024x682.png)

I’ve already talked about earning money online by teaching English. But maybe, it didn’t work for you. Because English wasn’t your language.

But still, you can earn money online if you’re an expert in your own language!

Like teaching English, a degree can be helpful in the case of other languages. But just like teaching English online, don’t worry if you don’t have one.

There are many websites where you can teach people language online. But all of them mightn’t work for you. Because every language isn't available on all the websites. So, you must check each website whether your language is available or not.

If you find that you can’t teach your language on any one of those websites, you can still earn money online. You’ll have to offer your service in the freelancing sites, such as Fiverr, Upwork, Freelancer.com, etc.

Italki is the largest online language teaching platform with 10,000+ teachers from more than 130 countries and more than 5 million users. It has a fair commission rate also. Italki charges only a 15% commission on lesson fees. Two other excellent alternatives to Italki are Verbling and Tandem.

### 24\. Network Marketing

![](./images/image-1-1024x682.jpeg)

Network Marketing means recruiting people to sell products. It is also known as MLM (Multi-Level Marketing).

It exists for a long-time. But it had bad reputations in the past. Because then, they only focused on recruiting, not on selling products. And many companies had to shut down due to a lack of sales.

But days have changed. Now, many companies are getting more sales using network marketing.

Network Marketing is an excellent way to make money online. It’s nothing unfamiliar. It is just a variation of Affiliate Marketing.

You’ll get paid for every sale you and your recruiters make. If you’re promoting a product priced at $100, and the commission is 20%, then you’ll earn $20,000 monthly if you can make 2000 sales each month.

There are also no shortages of available products to promote. Starting from a few cents to as high as thousands of dollars. The commission rates can range from as low as 1% to 50% or even more. And if someone sign-ups to the program using your referral link, then you’ll also earn for each sale they make.

To make enough sales, you need to work hard to promote the product. And a blog is the best place to do it. Start a blog and start building an email list. You can also use social media to increase sales. But do it wisely.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online from Network Marketing

How much money you’ll earn depends on how much sales you make. The more you make, the more you get. And the less you make, the less you get.

If the average commission rate of the products you’re promoting is 20%, and the average price is $100, and if you make 100 sales per month, then you’ll earn $2,000 monthly. And if you make 10,000 sales, you’ll earn $200,000 monthly!!!

### 25\. Sell Stock Photographs

![](./images/image-57-1024x678.jpeg)

Do you’ve got a hand on photography? Or are you a professional photographer? If your answers are yes, then you can make good passive income from stock photographs and videos.

Because every people who have a business online, from a blogger to a billion-dollar businessman, need stock photographs.

Though stock photographs are inexpensive, it is a good source of passive income. Because probably you’ll shoot hundreds or thousands of photos every month. And you’re not limited to just one website. You can upload your photographs and videos on many websites.

But you can’t just upload a lot of photos and hope they sell. You’ll have to upload the photographs that actually sell.

You need to use the right keywords for your photos. Use keywords that aren’t too broad. Probably many photographers are already competing for those keywords.

You shouldn’t capture anything you think great. Try to pick a niche to shoot for. And use Google Trends to check what is trending now.

There are many websites to publish your photos and videos. But the problem is, you don’t give them a commission. Instead, they give you a commission for each download. Still, of them, the best websites are:

- **Shutterstock:** Though Shutterstock is the biggest stock website, it is the lowest-paying (or the greediest). They only pay a 15% commission at Level 1. And you need more than 25,000 photos and video downloads to get to Level 6. At level 6, you’ll get a 40% commission for every download. To make the thing worse, levels on photo-licensing and video-licensing are different. And, to make things even worse, all the progress reset on the first day of a new year.
- **Pond5:** Pond5 commission rates are much better than Shutterstock. They share 40% of revenue for non-exclusive video licenses and 60% revenue share for exclusive video licenses. And 35% revenue share for music and sound effects, and 50% for photographs.
- **iStock:** iStock also has the lowest commission like Shutterstock. Only 15% for photos, and 20% for videos and illustrations. And for an exclusive license, commission rates start at 25% and goes up to 45% commission on each sale.
- **Adobe Stock:** Adobe Stock has a commission rate of 33% for photos and vector arts, and 35% for videos.
- **500px:** 500px has a better commission structure than most other websites. It gives 60% to their contributors for exclusive-licenses, and 30% for non-exclusive licenses.

You can also start your own website to show your works, and if someone finds that your photos are great, they can license those paying a fee. You’ll also get the full amount to keep.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online Selling Stock Photographs

How much money you'll earn depends mainly on three factors. Such as how much you're getting per photo, how many downloads you get, and the commission rates.

If you are getting $4 per photo on average, and your photos get 1,000 downloads per month, then you can earn anywhere between $600-$2,400 per month.

It means that you’ll earn more if you get a higher commission and more downloads. So, try to shoot as many stock-quality photos as possible and upload them on as many websites as possible.

If your photos get more than a million downloads per month, you can expect to earn even $600,000 up to $2.4M a month!!! And, if you’re selling your photos on your website, then that’s even more, $4M!!!!

### 26\. Start a Facebook Fan Page

![](./images/image-53-1024x680.jpeg)

Nowadays, most Facebook users have a page of their own. Many even have multiple pages.

But not every page is popular. Gaining popularity isn't so easy. Only a few pages can make it to millions of followers!!

It has become too hard to grow your audience organically. Because Facebook has changed its algorithm a lot in the last few years.

But you can’t just blame Facebook. There are millions of Facebook pages. So, getting thousands of likes isn't so easy at all.

But you can invite all of your friends and ask them to invite their friends. It’ll help you to collect a few hundred likes on your page.

Publishing posts regularly on your page is very important. And rich media are more engaging than texts on social platforms. So, try to add shareable images and a video if you can.

After you’ve managed to get a high enough number of followers, you can start making money from your page. If you’ve 100,000 followers, the best way to monetize your page is _Sponsored Post_. You can earn around $1500 for a single sponsored post if you have 100,000 followers.

But if your page doesn’t have that number of followers, then you can use affiliate marketing to generate some income. Or, you can do what everyone is doing, direct your followers to your website. You can also set up a store on your page.

#### How to monetize a Facebook page via Facebook Monetization

Recently Facebook has introduced Facebook Monetization for videos like YouTube Monetization. There are 4 ways to monetize a FB page. These are:

- **In-stream Ads:** You can display short ads on your videos to earn money. To be eligible for _In-stream Ads_, you need to have at least 10,000 followers and 30,000 1-minute views for 3-minute videos in the last 60 days.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online from A Facebook Page

There is no accurate answer to this question, only calculations. Facebook is mainly used by bloggers to drive traffic to their websites. And then, they earn money from ads, affiliate links, etc.

So, if the average RPM of your website is $10, and you are getting 100,000 monthly readers from your FB page, then you’ll earn $1,000/mo. And if you do three sponsored posts per month, then that’s another $3K-$4.5K.

You can also make money from your videos through FB monetization. If your videos are getting 100,000 ad views per month, and your CPM rate is around $2, then you’ll earn $2K/mo.

If you have also set up a store on your page, then you’ll also earn money from your store. If you’ve 1 million followers, then you may be able to sell 10-100 products per month. So, if you are making $10-$100 per sale, then you’ll earn $100-$10K per month.

So, from the above amounts, I can say that you can earn around $5K-$15K/mo from a single FB page that has 1 million followers!

Heat transfer is the second technique. It's best for printing photographs or abstract designs, but it is less durable. Direct-to-garment is the third method. It is best for complicated and colorful designs, but not cost-effective for high-volume printing. Choose the technique that best fits your need.

Buying and holding an inventory might increase the profit margin. But a print-on-demand service reduces the risks and takes a lot less time.

### 32\. Narrate Audiobooks

![](./images/image-44-1024x682.jpeg)

While the publishing industry is declining every year, electronic formats are becoming increasingly popular. And the Audiobook industry is just booming! The short answer to why is, people aren’t going blind, but people are being busier (or LAZIER!).

But hard-working people are always rewarded. And if you’re well at voice-acting, you can make good money narrating audiobooks online.

Anyone can read, but very few people can express their imagination through their voices, like one in a thousand. So, narrating audiobooks might not be for you if you’re not among those few people.

ACX (Audiobook Creative Exchange), owned by Amazon and Audible, lets you connect with people who want to convert their book into an audio format. Joining ACX is very simple, sign up, put some samples, and do auditioning for jobs. ACX won’t cut a single penny from your earnings.

The auditioning system of ACX is also simple. You’ll have to narrate one or two pages, and then submit the audio file. Then the _Rights Holder_ will review your narration, and if he/she thinks you are the best, you’ll get the job.

You can get paid in three ways in ACX. Per-Finished-Hour, 50/50 Royalty Share, or a combination of both. The employer will select the payment method, but you can still set your preference in your profile.

Probably, an employer won’t resist a single compromise in audio quality. So, a good microphone is a must. And a good mic stand, pop filter, headphone, and a quiet space is also as necessary as a mic.

You’ll also need an audio-editing software to edit the audio file. Adobe Audition and Reaper are the two best software for audio editing. But these aren’t a must to produce a great audiobook. A free tool like Audacity is much more than enough.

If you’ve gained experience in the ACX, you should start offering your service on the other freelancing platforms. In ACX, you’ll generally make $80-$100 per audio-hour. But as a professional narrator, you can earn $200 per audio hour or even more!

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online as An Audiobook Narrator

An audiobook narrator can earn as high as $200 or even more per audio hour. And if you take the same time to edit the audiobook, then it’s still $100/hr. If you get regular works, then that translates into an annual salary of $200K!!

Many narrators even earn passive income narrating audiobooks by revenue share. They earn $2,500 or more passive income monthly. And some of them are making it just from a single book!

### 33\. Buy and Sell Domains

![](./images/image-1-1024x586.png)

Domains are the real estate of the virtual world. Domain Flipping or buying & selling domain names are much like selling ready-made websites. But the price of a premium domain is much more volatile than the price of a website.

Domain flipping is coming as a popular way to earn money online. Because it is a lucrative business (you can also take it as a side-hustle). If you can properly execute the plan, you can earn even millions of dollars for a single domain.

Great domain names have been sold at $5 million, $7 million, $16 million (insure.com), $35 million (Vacation Rentals)! Or, even more, $90 million (LasVegas.com)!!! Or, even more at a staggering $842 million (Cars.com)!!!!!!!

But getting this type of price for a single domain name has become impossible nowadays. Because millions of people and thousands of flippers are registering millions of domain names every day. As a result, it has become tough to even sell a great domain name for over $1K or even $100.

But still, thousands of flippers are flipping domains every day. But why? Because they know how to execute a strategy.

Selling domain names for making money isn’t as easy as buying a domain for your blog or website. You’ve to care about many things when purchasing a domain name. A great domain name is:

- Not your nickname. Your nickname might be suitable for your own blog. Some have even made thousands of dollars selling it. But not everyone is this lucky. And those lucky men had to wait years to get an offer. So, reconsider your choice.
- A brandable name
- A dictionary word
- A top keyword
- A name that represents a niche
- A name that people are interested in
- Most of the times a .com domain

If you’ve cracked out a great domain name, it isn’t all. You must avoid any legal risks involved. If you think of buying a domain name similar to Facebook.com or a new TLD of Facebook, your domain name can get forfeited. So, don't try to trick anyone!

If the domain name you want is available, then buy it cheap at Porkbun or GoDaddy. But if it is unavailable, then leave it. If you still want the domain name, you can contact the owner by checking the information at WhoIS.com.

Flippa and SEDO are also two great places to buy domains. There you’ll find a lot of brandable, top keyword, dictionary word domain names. But as you’re buying from a flipper, you’ll have to spend much more to get the ownership of the domain name.

You can also search for the domain names that are going to be expired soon or have gone recently at ExpiredDomains and JustDropped. Because they can be great domain names. And you’ll get them at the same price as new domain names.

If you’ve bought the domain names, now you’ve to list in a marketplace for sale. SEDO and Flippa are the two best websites for selling a premium domain name. GoDaddy is another great place if you want to sell the domain names at an auction.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online Buying and Selling Domain Names

If you want to sell a domain name quickly, then you can get $40-$4K or more per domain. It varies by domain names.

But if you want to sell the domain names for a higher price, you may need to hold the domains for a long time. You can get a few hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions like the above domain names. But it can also happen that you’ll never be able to sell the domain names.

If you go for the quicker process, and sell 100 domain per month, and get $50 per domain on average, then you’ll earn $5K a month! And if you buy the domain names from other flippers at $40, you’ll still earn $1K. And you’ll definitely make more than this if you can sell 100 domains a month. As you’ll get over $50, or even $100 for at least some domain names.

### 39\. Provide Consultation Service to SMBs

![](./images/questions-2212771_1280-1024x681.jpg)

Thousands of businesses hire consultants to receive actionable advice. A consultant can play a vital role in growing a business. Because of this, the consultation service is a highly-profitable business.

Consultants exist in every niche and sector possible. A consultant is basically an expert who earns money selling actionable advice. If you’re an expert on just anything, you can start making money online right now.

Consultation service is a highly-flexible work. You’ll not need to leave your day-job or your online business. You just have to answer your client’s questions with details. And that doesn’t take hours!

If you’re a blogger, consultation service can be an additional source of revenue for you. Many successful bloggers are offering consultation services and earning a decent amount of money as a side-hustle.

Freelancing platforms mightn’t be the best option for finding clients for your consultation service. If you are a successful blogger, you shouldn’t miss the chance to get clients directly from your audience.

Outreaching is the best way to get clients for your consulting business. For example, if you’re a marketing consultant, search for companies and blogs who aren’t maximizing their marketing efforts and offer them your consultation service. Or, if you’re an SEO expert, offer them SEO consultation services.

Though freelancing platforms, in this case, aren’t the best choices, they’re not the worst. You should use both freelancing and social sites to get more consultation jobs. Those can be a great choice if you’re just starting.

Note: As a consultant, provide only the actionable advice you know will work. You’ll also need to outsource any work you aren’t expert at. Because if you fail in any one of the two cases, it can be a big turndown for your business.

![](./images/image-41-1024x714.jpeg)

Are you an expert in a subject? Do you think that you can solve people’s problems? Then you can earn money sharing your expertise through phone calls.

It is very much the same as earning money by answering questions. But in this case, you’ll be solving much more complex problems, instead of answering just a simple written question.

There are different ways to start earning money online in this way. One of the best ways is joining a company as a phone support staff. You’ll be paid a flat salary or per-call basis. Or, you can directly outreach to different companies or offer your service in the freelancing platforms.

You can also join some websites like PrestoExperts, 6ya, Ether, etc. You can set your own rate, the rate at which people will call you. You’ll be able to make around $2/min. And as usual, those companies will cut a commission from your earning.

Another great idea is starting a phone support business of your own. It can happen by both audio and video calls, or offline and online calls. The best way is grabbing a _Revenue Generating Number_, where a caller will have to pay to call you.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online Sharing Expertise Through Phone Calls

In the US, the average annual salary of a customer service job is just over $36K. If you want to join a website like PrestoExperts, you’ll get paid $2 per minute. After deducting all the fees and other expenses, you may earn around $1.20/min.

### 47\. Prepare Taxes

![](./images/image-11-1024x538.jpeg)

_Tax Preparation_ is an intimidating task. Taxpayers need to claim all the credits and deductions to pay only the exact amount of taxes they owe. Or, they could end up paying a lot of extra money.

For this reason, millions of people get their tax prepared by a professional. If you have the necessary skills, you can also leverage your talent to earn a decent amount of money.

You don't need to be a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) to prepare taxes for money. Anyone over 18 years can register as a tax professional.

To start getting paid for preparing taxes for others, you need to do several things first. They’re:

- You must obtain a PTIN (Preparer Taxpayer Identification Number) to receive payments for preparing taxes. It costs $64.24 for the first year and $63 for renewal.

IRS (The revenue service of the United States federal government) and some states offer both paid and free programs and courses that you can take. There are also many comprehensive courses made by professionals you can take.

- Check out your state's website if they require any additional certifications.
- Purchase a surety bond to keep your customers safe and form an LLC to keep yourself safe if anything wrong occurs

If you’ve done all of this, now you can start getting clients. You can try searching your inner circle first if anyone needs your service. Use freelancing platforms and social media effectively to market your services and get your potential clients. You can also join in a tax firm like H&R Block or Jackson Hewitt.

You’ll find a lot of people searching for tax professionals during the Tax Season. You can make a decent amount of money at that time. But for the rest of the year, you’ll not get many works.

So, you can add accounting, bookkeeping, or other financial services to your knowledge to land more gigs around the year. Or, you can work more in the tax season to enjoy the rest of the year.

_**Note:**I had to take some of the above information from the official website of the IRS. So, thoseare only applicable to the US residents. If you live outside the US, you need to do some research on your own first._

![](./images/image-22-1024x683.jpeg)

Ridesharing has grown tremendously popular in the past years. Since the launch of Uber in 2009 as the first ridesharing app, many more apps have emerged. Nowadays, it is one of the most popular ways to make money on the side.

Many car owners are driving in their free time to make some extra cash. If you’ve access to a car (not too old model), have some driving experience, and at least 18 years old, then you can also make money driving. It is also possible to earn money if you have a motorbike.

There are many ridesharing apps available in the market around the globe. But not all of them are available in every country or every state. So, check out the apps to find out what works best for you.

Uber is the dominating app in the ridesharing market. The second most popular is Lyft. Both of these apps are great at what they do. Their pricing & pay structure are also very similar. Uber shines in its huge-size, and Lyft is reported as more driver-friendly. They’re both available around the world.

Wingz is another great ridesharing app you can use to schedule a route in advance and at a flat rate. It may better-fit those drivers who want everything calculated.

![](./images/image-48-1024x768.jpeg)

Food and Product Delivery is another excellent way to make money by using your car. You can also deliver products if you have a scooter, a bike, or a bicycle., or even a truck!

People don’t have much time to spend their free time running errands. Instead, they hire a man to get their foods, groceries, products delivered directly to their house.

Same as ridesharing, there is no shortage of apps for product delivery. And most of them are only available in just one part of the globe. So, you must check out the apps and websites to find out which works best for you.

Postmates, Shipt, InstaCart, GrubHub, UberEats, DoorDash are some of the best apps for making money doing deliveries. Deliv and Caviar are another two apps that claim that their pay-rates are slightly higher than the other apps.

Amazon Flex, UPS & FedEx also hire drivers occasionally. You can expect to get regular works and a better pay-rate from them. But they don’t always hire people, and getting selected is hard also.

GoShare is another platform, especially for truckers. It connects businesses and individuals in your area for cargo deliveries. If you don’t have a truck, you can still apply as a helper. A helper helps truckers to lift heavy products. Both helpers and truckers can earn much more than usual product delivery.

### 54\. Get Cashback on Purchases

![](./images/image-5-1024x769.png)

_Cashback_ is a great way to save money. It isn’t really a money-making method, but indeed a money-saving method. And the money saved is the money earned. You’ve to do nothing to get cashbacks but buy the products you buy usually.

Cashback apps don’t offer a discount before making a purchase. They give free money after making a purchase. But why do those apps give free money?

Because they've partnered with many brands and retailers. When you make a purchase using their app, those brands give them a portion of their earning. And as you made a purchase using their app, they reward you with free money.

There are many cashback apps and websites. Not all of them are great, nor all of them are legit. But many excellent cashback apps can reduce your expenses by up to 40% or more. Rakuten, Ibotta, ShopKick, Paribus, TopCashbacks are some of the best cashback apps.

Rakuten (Formerly Ebates) is probably the best among them. It works with more than 2500 retailers. So, you can get cashbacks on many more products than other apps. Ibotta is another excellent cashback app. It works best for grocery shopping.

ShopKick is a little bit different. It lets you earn money without actually buying the products. You just have to walk into stores and scan the barcodes of the products. But to get a cashback, you've to buy something.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online from Cashback Apps

It depends on the amount of cashback. If you get 10% cash back on every purchase and spend $1,000 every month, then you’ll make $100 per month. If it is 20%, then you’ll save $200. If you get 20%-30% cashback on average, then it translates into a whopping $2400-$3600 free money annually!!

Tips: Apply a coupon code combined with a cashback

There are many coupon websites and apps online. You can use them to get a discount on a product. After that, you can still use the above apps to get a cashback (if available). You may make $600 instead of $300 when a coupon is combined with a cashback. So, you’ll have to spend $400 to buy a $1,000 product!!!

#### Essential Websites & Apps: Rakuten, Ibotta, ShopKick, TopCashbacks

### 55\. Claim Cashback on Price Drop on Purchased Products

![](./images/image-19-1024x663.jpeg)

How will you feel if you buy a product and find that the price drops just after a few days? I know it’s really frustrating. So, I have come with an app named Paribus to help you.

Paribus is a cashback app, but it works differently. It negotiates with brands and refunds your money if the price drops a few days after you buy a product online. It generally takes around 7-days to get the money back.

You’ll have to grant access to your email account to Paribus. Because Paribus has to check your emails to know what purchases you’ve made. If a price-drop happens, it’ll automatically ask the retailer for a refund. But for a few retailers, it’ll only notify you to ask for a refund.

Paribus can also monitor the delivery of a product. If any late delivery happens, Paribus will hold the business accountable for this and will ask for compensation.

Paribus is a great app. It can monitor purchases from 25+ primary retailers. Many people complain that it doesn’t work, but it works and works great. It works only if the price drops after a few days. So, you can’t expect to get a refund after weeks or months have passed.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Using Paribus

You’ll get the full amount of refunded money to keep. Paribus won’t cut a single penny from your earnings.

#### An Alternative to Paribus

There is also another app like Paribus. Its name is Earny. It can also refund your money on the occurrence of a price-drop. But there are some differences between Earny and Paribus. Of them, the key differences are:

- Paribus is a free service, while Earny is a paid service. You have to pay $47.99 annually or $7.99 monthly to use their service.
- Paribus works with 25+ retailers when Earny can monitor price-drops from 15 retailers.
- Earny shares your contact information with its partners. Paribus doesn’t. Earny does this to get you promotional deals from its partners.
- Earny can also offer price-protection on credit cards. Paribus doesn’t have this feature.

### 60\. Sell Your Old Books Online

![](./images/books-1204029_1280-1-1024x681.jpg)

Probably you’ve left college many days or years ago. But do you still have your textbooks at your home? If you have, then I think you don’t need them now. You may also have many other books here and there at your home.

So, why are you keeping those when you can turn them into cash? The online marketplaces have opened up opportunities to sell used books for a fair price that you could never before.

Probably you’ll want to sell your books at a garage sale or a second-hand book store. But you’ll end up selling your books at cheap. So, consider selling your books online to get better deals.

Many companies buy back used books. And BookScouter is an excellent website for this. It compares the buy-back price of a book from various companies. And then it shows you the best price you can sell your book for.

You just need to enter the book name, or its author name or the ISBN. Then, BookScouter will show you which vendor is offering the best buy-back price for your book. It can currently compare buy-back prices from 50 vendors!

Not always, you’ll find a buy-back deal for your book. Companies offer buy-back deals most often for textbooks or other study-books. But there are also other places online to get a fair price for your old book.

If you want to sell your books locally, you can use Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. eBay is also a great place to get the best possible price for your book.

### 61\. Buy & Resell Old Books Online

![](./images/image-10-1024x768.jpeg)

Do you want to do something interesting to make some extra cash? Then you can take your bookselling skill one step further and start a reselling business online.

I just talked about making money online selling old books. If you’ve followed my steps and sold those, now you can start buying some. And sell them for a higher price to make a profit.

For the internet, it has now become easy to sell a used book for a fair price. But lots of books are still being sold cheaply. And you can buy those cheap books and resell them for the price they actually worth.

And also, don’t buy just any type of book. Not every kind of used book sells. You should buy only textbooks or publications from a famous writer, or first-editions. Collectible books are also great for purchasing, but it depends on their rarity.

Auctions, garage sales, and thrift stores are the best places to find cheap books. You can also ask your friends and family members if they want to sell their books.

After you’ve bought a book, spend some time to give it a better look. You should clean it properly and check if any page is missing. A well-looking book will certainly sell at a higher price.

First, check BookScouter to compare the buy-back deals available. If any offer is available, sell the book quickly to keep the focus on selling another book. It's a great tool you must have to make a decent amount of money reselling books.

But if a buy-back deal is currently not available, then the best option left is eBay. There are already thousands of buyers (or resellers like you) at eBay who are looking to buy used books. And, you'll also get a higher price on eBay.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online Reselling Books

You’ll have to buy a book for a lower price to increase the profit margin. So, use BookScouter to check if a buy-back deal is available before you buy a used book. It'll help you to avoid any loss and let you know how much money you'll be able to earn.

If you make $10 per each book and sell one book every day, you'll still be able to earn a cool $300 a month. And, if you bought those books for a super-cheap price or sell hundreds of books, then you can make 10X-100X, or even more than that!

Book-reselling is a lucrative business. You'll be amazed to know that when Amazon was founded in 1995, it was an online bookstore!!! And, now the net worth of Amazon has crossed $1,500 bn!!!

I’m talking about earning money online selling old clothes. But you can also new clothes using the following tactics I'll tell you now.

People depend on the photos of a product when they buy online. If you want to start a mini-business online selling clothes, you must upload high-quality pictures. You should-

- Consider purchasing a good camera once you have made some sales.
- Capture pictures of your clothes from every angle possible.
- Capture any flaw or flaws your clothes have.
- Use something like a wooden hanger to give your clothes a better look.

There are many places online to sell clothes. Depop is one app among them. Though it's a newer app, it has gained much popularity in a short time. And now, it's available in 150+ countries. And, many teenagers are making over $300,000 a year selling clothes at Depop. Poshmaker and ThredUp are another two great alternatives.

### 63\. Sell Used Phones

![](./images/image-30-1024x685.jpeg)

Electronic devices have become cheaper than ever before. You can grab a brand new phone at as little as $50.

But still used phones have a large market. And the market has grown much bigger than the past. If you’ve old phones in your house that you aren’t using, you can sell them at a fair price.

Selling a used phone isn't very hard. There are many buy-back companies like Gazelle, who buy-back used phones. You just have to go to their website, and they’ll offer you a fair price after you give them some info about your phone.

Or, if you want to earn some more, you can list your phone on eBay or Craigslist. There are a lot of people to buy your phone. You can also sell your phone to Amazon if you want something quicker. But you’ll get a little bit less than eBay or Craigslist.

Note: Don't try to hide any defect your phone has. You can get engaged in a dilemma or lose money instead of making money.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online Selling a Used Phone

It varies phone by phone. There are no exact numbers. If you have a damn old phone or a phone from a less-known brand, you can’t expect to get a high price. For most phones, you can generally get 60-70% of the retail price for a used phone, if it has no defects.

### 64\. Buy and Resell Used Phones

![](./images/image-8-1024x563.jpeg)

I just talked about making money from selling your old phone. I won’t talk about the same thing again. I am talking about taking it as a business and entering the big market.

Selling one used phone and starting a business of used phones is a lot different. But this doesn’t mean that it is impossible, nor so hard. You just have to take care of some things.

I said that there are many people on eBay and Craigslist to buy your used phone. The reason for being the number high is that they make money from it. They buy phones at low prices and resell them high to earn a profit.

You’ll find a lot of used phones on eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, and other marketplaces. Try to buy them at a low price. And the trick to turning the price all down is buying a phone with a defect.

Defected phones are much cheaper. And phones with broken screens most common. It’s also easy enough to find a replacement screen at a few dollars.

Replacing the screen gives an old phone a brand-new look. So, the profit margin will be higher than reselling used phones with old screens.

The profit margin is not so high when you’re reselling phones. You’ll not earn hundreds of bucks selling only one phone. So, try to acquire skills like fixing a broken screen and other parts on your own. It’ll save you a lot of money, even though a replacement screen is cheap.

When you buy an old phone, make sure that it isn’t stolen. You certainly won’t want to engage in a hassle. You can check its history using a service called checkMEND. It costs only 1.99£ to check on a phone's history.

After you’ve done all the things required for selling a used phone at a high price, sell it on eBay or Craigslist. Craigslist might be a more lucrative option as it doesn’t charge a fee, and every penny is important.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online from A Used-phone Reselling Business

There are no exact numbers I can say. If you gain $50 profit per phone, then you can easily make $350/week or $1,500/mo selling one phone a day. And, you can grow your business once you’ve accumulated a capital.

You can sell any electronic device you have, such as a laptop, DVD, PlayStation, TV, iPhone, iPad, etc. You’ll not get the price you paid for them. But you’ll get paid for some waste.

Gazelle, NextWorth, Decluttr, BuyBackBoss are some of the best websites to sell your electronics directly. They’ll offer you a buy-back deal instantly after collecting some details about your device. If you like the price, you can accept it. You can reject it also. It’s a great way to sell your devices quickly.

But those companies don’t offer you the best price. And also, they don’t accept every device. So, if you want to get a better value for your products, you should sell it locally. Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace are two great places for this. You’ll get a much better price there.

Or, you can also sell your devices on eBay. Often, you’ll get the best price on eBay. And if something like reselling business is in your mind, then eBay might be the best place for you.

#### How Much Money Can You Earn Online Selling Used Electronic Devices

You can expect to get around $0.001-$0.02 per ad on a PTC or GPT website. And, if you can watch six ads a minute, then you’ll earn as low as $0.36 to as high as $7.2 per hour.

But a website doesn’t have thousands of ads available to watch. So, you’ll only earn a few cents a day even if you get the highest rate possible. But you can make a lot from referrals.

You can earn $10-$15 monthly by just unlocking the phone screen using Slidejoy. That’s great for doing absolutely nothing. No doubt that you’ll get 20X-100X money if you spend all the time behind Slidejoy. But it’s not a good idea.
