WordPress is the most popular CMS which started its journey in 2003. And now more than 35% of the total websites are powered by WordPress.

WordPress has improved a lot in the past years. But its core functions don't meet all of our needs. Most of us don't know how to code a single line. So, we need to install plugins to extend the functions of our WordPress website.

But there are 55000+ WordPress plugins! Among them 20000+ are free. So, it can easily happen that you install a vast number of unnecessary plugins and slow down your website. Doing this can even break your site and make it vulnerable to attackers.

So, I have created this list of **8 Best WordPress Plugins** to enhance your website functionality while keeping its performance and security at high.

# 1\. Best WordPress Plugins for Caching

Speed is a factor that must be checked when it comes to a website. You must make your website to load under 3s (2s is better). To achieve this, you need to enable caching, minify website code, enable GZip compression, optimize your images, lazy-load your contents, and many more.

Doing all of this by yourself is a matter of headache. But these are something that must be done. So, you must hire a developer to automate the process. Or you can install a plugin that'll take care of all these for you.

# 3\. Best WordPress Plugins for Analytics

Analytics is very important for you if you are serious about your site. Google Analytics is a free service that can show your total visitor's count, information about your visitors, etc. metrics.

But getting used to Google Analytics takes time. Also finding advanced metrics can be difficult. So, developers have created many plugins to create this work easy for you. A WordPress analytics plugin can show your analytics data directly on your dashboard.

Its pricing structure is also very similar to Monsterinsights.

### What WordPress Analytics Plugin Should You Choose?

You should choose Monsterinsights. Also, you can use Exactmetrics. There is no difference between them. Both have a free plugin that is good for basic analytics.

# 4\. Best WordPress Plugins for Security

Security is important to all. It shouldn't be compromised a little bit. For security, a plugin isn't enough to protect your site. You should buy web hosting from a good host and install Cloudflare on your site.

A good host always keeps its hardware updated and scans for malware to keep your data safe. Cloudflare saves you from DDoS attacks, filter & block bad traffics, enable CDN, etc. It also offers a web application firewall (WAF). These are must and probably enough for your security.

Now, we come to the plugin. A plugin can help you further secure your website. It can also be very helpful if you don't use Cloudflare or have a bad hosting.
