And it is estimated to exceed $60 billion by 2024!!! It's just 2% of the global apparel market but a high enough number to attract most people.

Though I'll not talk about how to make money online reselling clothes, the numbers are relevant. Buying and reselling things is an exciting way to make some money on the side. You just have to buy low and sell high!

The internet has made buying, selling, and sharing this and that extremely easy. These trends are increasing day by day. So, today I have come up with **_4 Things to Buy and Resell to Make Money Online_**.

# 4 Things to Buy and Resell to Make Money Online

The secondhand market is increasingly getting bigger. People are now more interested than ever before in buying a used item. Because it is a useful way to save money.

But buying used items isn't the only way to follow the trend. Yeah, you have got it! You can buy the used items and resell them for profit to make money online.

You have already understood from the headline that after reading this post you'll get to know 4 things to resell to make money online. I have talked about everything in detail. I have also Madden links to necessary websites.

I have also mentioned how much money you'll be able to earn reselling an item. So, why are we waiting?! Let's jump into the post without talking further.

## 1\. Buy and Resell Old Books Online

Do you want to do something interesting to make some extra cash? Then you can take your bookselling skill one step further and start a reselling business online.

I have talked about making money online selling old books in this post. If you’ve followed my steps and sold them, now you can start buying some. And resell them at a higher price to make a profit.

Thanks to the internet, it has now become easy to sell a used book at a fair price. But lots of books are still being sold cheaply. And you can buy those cheap books and resell them at the price they actually worth.

And also, don’t buy just any type of book. Not every kind of used book sells. You should buy only textbooks or publications from a famous writer, or first-editions. Collectible books are also great for purchasing, but it depends on their rarity.

Auctions, garage sales, and thrift stores are the best places to find cheap books. You can also ask your friends and family members if they want to sell their books.

After you’ve bought a book, spend some time to give it a better look. You should clean it properly and check if any page is missing. A well-looking book will certainly sell at a higher price.

First, check [BookScouter](https://bookscouter.com/) to compare the buy-back deals available. If any offer is available, sell the book quickly to keep the focus on selling another book. It's a great tool you must have to make a decent amount of money reselling books.

But if a buy-back deal is currently not available, then the best option left is [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/). There are already thousands of buyers (or resellers like you) who are looking to buy used books. And, you'll also get a higher price at eBay.

#### How Much Money Can You Make Online Reselling Old Books

You’ll have to buy a book at a low price to make a good profit. So, use BookScouter to check if a buy-back deal is available before you buy a used book. It'll help you to avoid any loss and let you know how much money you'll be able to earn.

If you make $10 per book and sell one book every day, you'll still be able to earn a cool $300 a month. And, if you bought those books at a super-cheap price or sell hundreds of books, then you can make 10X-100X, or even more than that!

Book-reselling is a lucrative business. You'll be amazed to know that when Amazon was founded in 1995, it was an online bookstore!!! And, now the net worth of Amazon has crossed $1,500 bn!!!

## 2\. Buy and Resell Used Phones

![](./images/word-image-37.jpeg)

I have talked about making money selling used phones in this post. I won’t talk about the same thing again. Now, I’ll talk about taking it as a business and entering the big market.

Selling one used phone and starting a business of used phones is a lot different. But it doesn’t mean that it’s impossible, nor so hard. You just have to take care of some things.

I said that there are many people on eBay and Craigslist to buy used phones. The reason for being the number so high is that they make money from it. They buy phones at low prices and resell them to earn a profit.

You’ll find a lot of used phones on eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, and other marketplaces. Try to buy them at a low price. And the trick to turning the price all down is buying a phone with a defect.

Defected phones are a lot cheaper. And phones with broken screens are the most common. It’s also easy enough to find a replacement screen for a few dollars.

Replacing the screen gives an old phone a brand-new look. So, the profit margin will be higher than reselling used phones with old screens.

The profit margin is not so high when you’re reselling phones. You’ll not earn hundreds of bucks selling only one phone. So, try to acquire skills like fixing a broken screen and other parts on your own. It’ll save you a lot of money, even though a replacement screen is cheap.

When you buy an old phone, make sure that it isn’t stolen. You certainly won’t want to engage in a hassle. You can check its history using a service called [CheckMEND](https://www.checkmend.com/). It costs only 1.99£ to check on a phone's history.

After you’ve done all the things required for selling a used phone at a high price, sell it on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/) or [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.org/). Craigslist might be a more lucrative option as it doesn’t charge a fee, and every penny is important.

#### How Much Money Can You Make Online Reselling Used Phones

There are no exact numbers I can say. If you gain $50 profit per phone, then you can easily make $350/week or $1,500/mo reselling one phone a day. And, you can grow your business once you’ve accumulated capital.

## 3\. Buy and Resell Domain Names

![](./images/word-image-5.png)

Domain names are the real estate of the virtual world. Domain Flipping or buying & selling domain names is much like selling ready-made websites. But the price of a domain is much more volatile than the price of a website.

Buying and reselling domains is now a popular way to earn money online. Because it is a lucrative business idea. It is also as good for a side-hustle. If you can properly execute a strategy, you can make even millions of dollars selling a single domain!!!

Great domain names have been sold at $5 million, $7 million, $16 million (Insure.com), $35 million (VacationRentals.com)! Or, even more, $90 million (LasVegas.com)!!! Or, even more at a staggering $842 million (Cars.com)!!!!!!!

But getting a price like these for a single domain name has become impossible nowadays. Because millions of people and thousands of flippers are registering millions of domain names every day. As a result, it has become tough to even sell a great domain name for over $1K or even $100.

But still, thousands of flippers are buying and reselling domain names every day. But why? Because they know how to make money from it just executing a strategy correctly.

Selling domain names for making money isn’t as easy as buying a domain for your website. You’ve to care about many things when purchasing a domain name. A great domain name is:

- **Not your nickname**. Your nickname might be suitable for your own blog. Some have even made thousands of dollars selling it. But not everyone is this lucky. And those lucky men had to wait years to get an offer. So, reconsider your choice.
- **A brandable name**
- **A dictionary word**
- **A top keyword**
- **A name that represents a niche**
- **A name that people are interested in**
- Most of the times, **a .com domain**

If you’ve cracked out a great domain name, it isn’t the end. You must avoid any legal risks involved. If you think of buying a domain name similar to Facebook.com or a new TLD of Facebook, your domain name can get forfeited. So, don't try to trick anyone!

If the domain name you want is available, then buy it cheap at [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) or [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/). But if it is unavailable, then leave it. If you still want the domain name, you can contact the owner by checking the information at [Whois](https://www.whois.com/).com.

[Flippa](https://flippa.com/) and [SEDO](https://sedo.com/us/) are also two great places to buy domains from flippers. There you’ll find a lot of brandable, top keyword, dictionary word domain names. But as you’re buying from a flipper, you’ll have to spend much more to get the ownership of the domain name.

You can also search for the domain names that are going to be expired soon or have gone recently at [Expired Domains](https://www.expireddomains.net/) and [Just Dropped](https://www.justdropped.com/). Because they can be great domain names. And you’ll get them at the same price as new domain names.

If you’ve bought a or a few domain names, now you’ve to list them in a marketplace for sale. SEDO and Flippa are two of the best websites for selling a premium domain name. GoDaddy is another great place if you want to sell the domain names at an auction.

#### How Much Money Can You Make Online Reselling Domain Names

If you want to sell a domain name quickly, then you can get $40-$4K or even more per domain! It varies by domain names.

If you want to sell the domain names at a higher price, you may need to hold them for a long time. You can get even a few hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions like the above domain names! But it can also happen that you’ll never be able to sell them.

If you go for the quicker process, and sell 100 domains per month, and get $50 per domain on average, then you’ll earn $5K a month! And if you buy the domain names from other flippers at $40, you’ll still earn $1K. And you’ll definitely make more than this if you can sell 100 domains a month. As you’ll get over $50, or even $100 for at least some domain names.

![](./images/word-image-38.jpeg)

On average, the share market grows by 10% every year. Many people invest in the stock market, hoping that they’ll make a profit. But most of them leave trading after some days. They fail at effectively executing a strategy.

Buying and reselling stocks involves risks. But with the rise of the internet, numerous free and paid educational resources have been available on how to successfully trade in the stock market. It has reduced the risks involved a lot.

If you want to invest in the stock market, then you can start online right now! To start trading online, you need to pick a trading website that is best for you.

Before buying any stock, conduct enough market research first. A good trading website always has all the research tools needed.

You must play safely in the share market. If you’re just starting, you should only buy stocks in the mid-cap or high-cap companies. You can also buy dividends to make sure money. Another safe investment can be purchasing an IPO. Because maybe it’s the lowest price it’ll receive in its life.

To make a profit in the share market, you need to buy low and sell high. So, keep patience. Don’t do the opposite in panic. Prices of stocks can drop but don’t sell them out of fear. And maybe it is the best time to buy more shares.

The key to success in the stock market is patience. Buy only good stocks, and keep them for a long time before selling. Maybe day-trading is lucrative for a short time. Yet significant risk is involved. Even you can lose all your money in greed.
